# Call Center Dashboard - PwC Forage Task

This project demonstrates a **Call Center Dashboard** created using Power BI as part of my PwC Forage task. The dashboard helps managers monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) for call center operations and provides actionable insights to improve performance.

## 📊 Dashboard Overview
- **Calls Answered**: Tracks the percentage of answered and unanswered calls.
- **Calls Resolved**: Monitors the resolution rate of calls.
- **Average Speed of Answer (ASA)**: The average time taken to answer calls.
- **Average Satisfaction Rating**: Gauges customer satisfaction across interactions.
- **Agent Statistics Table**: Provides individual agent performance on key metrics.
- **Call Volume by Month**: Shows trends in call volume for different months.
